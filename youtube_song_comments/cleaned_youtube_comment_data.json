dreams\nWe're all right where we should be\nWith my arms out wide I open my eyes\nAnd now all I wanna see\nIs a sky full of lighters\nA sky full of lighters\n\nBy the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up\nI would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up\nIf I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,\nFighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em' skyward uh\nHad a dream I was king, I woke up, still king\nThis rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,\nTill nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me\nI swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music\nThere is or there ever will be, disagree?\nFeel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up\nOnly thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses\nExcuse me if my head is too big for this building\nAnd pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick\nPoppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit\nWho you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite\nYou stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks\nI love it when I tell 'em shove it\nCause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, lustered\n'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing\nBrain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz\nNow you wonder why he does it, how he does it\nWasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head\nWaiting for him to drop dead, was it?\nOr was it, 'cause them bitches wrote him off\nLittle hussy ass buzzards, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it\nWhat difference it make?\nWhat it take to get it through your thick skulls\nAs if this ain't some bullshit\nPeople don't usually come back this way\nFrom a place that was dark as I was in\nJust to get to this place\nNow let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage\nAnd let it be known from this day forward\nI wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength\nSo let 'em

buying four or five of the homies the iron man Audi\nMy daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it\nAnd I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute\nTo tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr.Dre on the Chronic\nTell him how real he is or how high I am\nOr how I would kill for him for him to know it\nI cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back\nSo it's only right that I right\nTill he can march right\nInto that post office and tell 'em to hang it up\nNow his career's Lebron's jersey in twenty years\nI'll stop when I'm at the very top\nYou shitted on me on your way up\nIt's 'bout to be a scary drop\nCause what goes up must come down\nYou going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box\nEvery hour, happy hour now\nLife is wacky now\nUsed to have to eat the cat to get the pussy\nNow I'm just the cats meow, ow\nClassic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao\nY'all are doomed\nI remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me\nMy car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes\n'Cause now I'm in the Aston\nI went from having my city locked up\nTo getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick\nAnd now I'm fantastic\nCompared to a weed high\nAnd y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV\nSee me, we fly\nY'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive\nAnd how real is that\nI remember signing my first deal\nAnd now I'm the second best I can deal with that\nNow Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag\n\nYou and I know what it's like to be kicked down\nForced to fight, but tonight we're alright\nSo hold up your light, let it shine 'cause\n\nThis one's for you and me, living out our dreams\nWe're all right where we should be\nWith my arms out wide I open my eyes\nAnd now all I wanna see\nIs a sky full of

First off they don\u2019t use straight jackets anymore that\u2019s been long gone for a very long time now. Now a days mental hospitals use 4 point restraints and what they called a \u201cchemical straight jacket\u201d which is medication via IV to calm someone down and make them more Compliable. Also a lot of modern day mental hospitals don\u2019t use keys anymore for there main doors rather they use key CARDS. So anything key wise would be gone and not able to use. So trying to escape from there would be difficult really almost impossible bc there\u2019s at least one person ALWAYS watching the milu as well as halls. Plus the staff there do either 15 min checks or 30 mins depending on what your behavioral mood is on the charts. Also visiting hours are very limited and with staff needing key cards and badges he would of never gotten in. Even if he would of cane on visiting hours which would be only an hour long MAYBE 2 if your lucky and there\u2019s always someone watching the whole group while everyone is talking to their visitors. So trying to just walk out would be impossible without someone seeing you then like I said you would need a key card. So this video is very ignorant and lacks knowledge of how mental hospitals work and I\u2019m sure they just went off of what they believe it would be like bc clearly someone had no idea what it\u2019s like. And they all went with it based off of pure ignorance.", "I love this somg", "I love this song", "That\u2019s my mom and my dad befor", "I'm a girl who was mad at a friend last night his name is Nate waters last night I want to do something about myself so I told him I would do something about it he said no don't.

Penn St football is back. ....and that Saquon Barkley is a baaaaaaddd boy!\" The crowd was so hyped up. Then, he told us how he and head football coach James Franklin went fishing at Raystown Lake earlier. And they were tweeeting one another all week before the concert. Luke said he was so excited to be back at PS. Then he said 'You know what? I'm going to bring out a special friend. a good friend of mine to introduce this next song.\" Then, coach Franklin emerged from center stage and they sang the song together......Yo. the entire arena nearly imploded!

One time I was in my classroom hard at work studying for an upcoming exam. The room was quiet. Everyone was at peace. The entire class was focusing hard on their studies. While all of this was going on I saw a quan out of the corner of my eye. I don't know what came over me during this moment, but I screamed \"hit the quan\" at the top of my lungs. I ran over to that quan as if I were the flash, and I started pulverizing that dirty quan into submission. I knew that I could not rest until that quan had been dealt with. After several minutes of intense fighting with that vile quan my teacher decided to pull me away and send me to the principal's office. I started a protest to make this injustice known, but nobody wanted to join my cause. It was at that moment that I knew that the world was gonna be against me. I was gonna have to fight my battle alone, with no one to help me. This wasn't going to be easy, but I suppose not everything in life is just sunshine and roses.
