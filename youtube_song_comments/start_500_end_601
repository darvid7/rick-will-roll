The video, which features a dancer from Lifetime’s "Dance Moms" bouncing around a decrepit apartment, is filled with the same irrepressible spirit that colors this song—that if Sia is going to drink like everyone else and party until dawn like everyone else, you’re going to be sure it’s her when you hear this on the radio.
