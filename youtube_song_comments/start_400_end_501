Is that Rihanna’s accent on the first verse? Is the call to have a drink Lea Michele’s attempt at a party rock anthem? But then, the chorus hits and Sia’s voice blasts off, the swelling strings propelling her past her contemporaries in the inspirational-pop stratosphere.\n\nIt’s a jaw-dropping vocal performance that’s enough to convince you she could have a stadium-touring career of her own, making her previously released solo material seem impossibly minor by comparison. The video, which features a dancer from Lifetime’s "Dance Moms" bouncing around a decrepit apartment, is filled with the same irrepressible spirit that colors this song—that if Sia is going to drink like everyone else and party until dawn like everyone else, you’re going to be sure it’s her when you hear this on the radio.
