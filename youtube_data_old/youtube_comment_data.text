First off they don’t use straight jackets anymore that’s been long gone for a very long time now. Now a days mental hospitals use 4 point restraints and what they called a “chemical straight jacket” which is medication via IV to calm someone down and make them more Compliable. Also a lot of modern day mental hospitals don’t use keys anymore for there main doors rather they use key CARDS. So anything key wise would be gone and not able to use. So trying to escape from there would be difficult really almost impossible bc there’s at least one person ALWAYS watching the milu as well as halls. Plus the staff there do either 15 min checks or 30 mins depending on what your behavioral mood is on the charts. Also visiting hours are very limited and with staff needing key cards and badges he would of never gotten in. Even if he would of cane on visiting hours which would be only an hour long MAYBE 2 if your lucky and there’s always someone watching the whole group while everyone is talking to their visitors. So trying to just walk out would be impossible without someone seeing you then like I said you would need a key card. So this video is very ignorant and lacks knowledge of how mental hospitals work and I’m sure they just went off of what they believe it would be like bc clearly someone had no idea what it’s like.

First off they don’t use straight jackets anymore that’s been long gone for a very long time now. Now a days mental hospitals use 4 point restraints and what they called a “chemical straight jacket” which is medication via IV to calm someone down and make them more Compliable. Also a lot of modern day mental hospitals don’t use keys anymore for there main doors rather they use key CARDS. So anything key wise would be gone and not able to use. So trying to escape from there would be difficult really almost impossible bc there’s at least one person ALWAYS watching the milu as well as halls. Plus the staff there do either 15 min checks or 30 mins depending on what your behavioral mood is on the charts. Also visiting hours are very limited and with staff needing key cards and badges he would of never gotten in. Even if he would of cane on visiting hours which would be only an hour long MAYBE 2 if your lucky and there’s always someone watching the whole group while everyone is talking to their visitors. So trying to just walk out would be impossible without someone seeing you then like I said you would need a key card.

First off they don’t use straight jackets anymore that’s been long gone for a very long time now. Now a days mental hospitals use 4 point restraints and what they called a “chemical straight jacket” which is medication via IV to calm someone down and make them more Compliable. Also a lot of modern day mental hospitals don’t use keys anymore for there main doors rather they use key CARDS. So anything key wise would be gone and not able to use. So trying to escape from there would be difficult really almost impossible bc there’s at least one person ALWAYS watching the milu as well as halls. Plus the staff there do either 15 min checks or 30 mins depending on what your behavioral mood is on the charts. Also visiting hours are very limited and with staff needing key cards and badges he would of never gotten in. Even if he would of cane on visiting hours which would be only an hour long MAYBE 2 if your lucky and there’s always someone watching the whole group while everyone is talking to their visitors. So trying to just walk out would be impossible without someone seeing you then like I said you would need a key card. So this video is very ignorant and lacks knowledge of how mental hospitals work and I’m sure they just went off of what they believe it would be like bc clearly someone had no idea what it’s like.
